# TabZero

A nice little and simple command palette for your browser. Navigate, search, and manage your tabs without touching your mouse.

I can't provide you the .xpi file you need to install the extension, addons right now. But what you can do is to use the `.zip` file release from the release, and temporarily install the extension, addons
